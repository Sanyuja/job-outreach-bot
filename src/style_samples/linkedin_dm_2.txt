Hi Aaron,

 I’m very interested in the Senior Data Scientist role. 
 I’ve led end-to-end ML projects, deployed production systems, and built models that directly drive business decisions across fast-moving teams.
 I’d love to bring that experience to a company tackling real-time fraud and risk at scale. Please check out my resume. I think I’d be a strong match for what you’re building.

 Thank you!
